	<h1> ABOUT US</h1>
	<p align="justify">Amarar Thiru. M.A. Krishnaswamy, A.M.I.S.E., M.I.C.E. (U.S.A.) F.I.M.I., a revered educationist par excellence, was born on 17th March 1913 in an agricultural family hailing from Manamadurai, Sivagangai District, Tamil Nadu. After a brilliant academic record in school and college, he began his career as a school teacher. He started acquiring his professional degrees through self-study. After a brief stint as a school teacher, he started a Private Engineering College in the name “College of Engineering Technology” to give coaching for Diploma Courses in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Automobile Engineering and Air-conditioning & Refrigeration.</p>
	    <p align="justify">In 1965, he started a nursery school with only 17 students at Nungambakkam, Chennai. Later on, this school has grown into a Matriculation Higher Secondary School recognized by the Government of Tamil Nadu. In order to run more educational institutions efficiently in the city, he formed an educational trust under the name “Krishnaswamy Educational Trust”(Regd.) and then he started a chain of schools, on self –financing basis, at various parts of Chennai viz., Nungambakkam (1965), Anna Nagar (1973) and Villivakkam(1986).</p>
	    <p align="justify">Thiru M.A.K. Balakrisshnan, the eldest son of our founder, has taken over the reign of the trust as the Chairman and Managing Trustee, when our founder reached his heavenly abode in 1988. He has further propelled the growth of the trust by starting three more educational institutions. He realised  the cherished dream of the founder to further women’s education by starting Shri Krishnaswamy College for Women in 2010 at Annanagar.</p>
	    <p align="justify">Within a short span of seven years, the college has grown by leaps and bounds. Shift II was started in 2018 - 2019 and the college at present offers 11 UG courses and 3 PG courses in the morning shift and 3 UG courses in the evening shift with a strength of nearly 3000 students. As far as the academic progress is concerned, no stone is left unturned. National / International conferences, workshops, seminars, guest lectures are a regular feature. </p>
	    <p align="justify">Besides academic progress, the college excels in extension activities too. Two units of NSS, YRC, RRC and Rotaract motivate the students play a vital role thus providing an exposure to learn life skills. Sports is yet another field, in which the students of Shri Krishnaswamy College win laurels. Making women empowered is the manthra of the institution. Accordingly several value based and add on courses are conducted. In short, Shri Krishnaswamy College, situated in the heart of the city, caters to the needs of one and all.</p>
